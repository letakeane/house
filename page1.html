        <p>With the rememberance, your heart starts racing.</p>
        <p><i>Calm down</i>, you tell yourself. It was probably ... the pipes or something.</p>
        <p>You lie there in the dark, part of you trying to go back to sleep, part of you tense and listening for another noise.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p><i>~ t h u d ~</i></p>
        <p>The faint sound, coming from somewhere outside your room, sends a spike of adrenaline through your system.</p>
        <p>Was that a footstep? Something falling? Maybe just a distant car door being shut.</p>
